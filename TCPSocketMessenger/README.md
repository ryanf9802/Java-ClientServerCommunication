# TCP Socket Messenger

This module is dedicated to hosting a server which allows clients to connect and send messages to and from the server.
The client code can be duplicated to any device on the same network as the device running the Server program.

This is done through a TCP socket.
On the server end, there are multiple commands that can be executed to message client(s) or manipulate them.
